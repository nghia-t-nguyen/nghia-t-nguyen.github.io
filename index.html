                <p>When software companies create new products, it can be difficult for others to know what to do with
                    them. As a developer educator, my job is to empower the next generation of developers to
                    build.<br><br>

                    Working with several developers, I learned about new things everyday, such as Docker, APIs,
                    Javascript, and .NET. When I reviewed their drafts, I often had to debug their code and explain it
                    to a larger audience. By helping other developers share their knowledge of software development, I
                    was able to help foster a stronger community between Twilio and developers.<br><br>

                    I also used my skills as a software developer to build new applications and use cases with Twilio's
                    products. So far, I've built 7 applications, such as using <a

                <p>The Pohnpeian language is a Micronesian language from the small island of Pohnpei with an estimated
                    30,000 native speakers. Due to its limited number of native speakers, this language is at risk of
                    disappearing. Furthermore, there are a limited number of accessible resources for those who want to
                    learn it.<br><br>
                    For my Capstone project at the University of South Carolina, my group is creating a mobile
                    application that serves as a language-learning application for the Pohnpeian language.<br><br>

                    With accessibility in mind, this project was created using Flutter— a cross-platform UI development
                    framework— so that applications can be made for both Android and iOS operating systems.
                    Additionally, the database will be done with Firebase.<br><br>

                    Throughout this project, we documented our research, personas, and requirements using GitHub wiki.
                    One of my roles in the group is to guide my teammates on the UI/UX. Using the information that we
                    had compiled on our GitHub wiki, I lead the team in prototyping the product on Figma.<br><br>

                <p>Vibrational frequencies between bonds are related to important properties in materials, such as
                    thermal and electrical conductivity. Methods using density functional theory to predict these
                    frequencies are computationally heavy. Therefore, being able to quickly compute the vibrational
                    frequencies of a large number of crystal lattice systems allows material scientists to screen
                    certain materials for the correct use.<br><br>

                    As a machine learning research assistant, I worked on improving and adapting the Global Attention
                    Graph Neural Network by Steph-Yves Louis to predict the vibrational frequencies given a graph of the
                    arrangement of atoms (POSCAR). One of the challenging adaptations I did was allow the model to
                    predict a variable number of outputs, since the number of frequencies is 3 times the number
                    of atoms.<br><br>

                    After successfully analyzing over 40,000 crystal samples and fine-tuning the parameters to create an
                    optimal model, I contributed to a <a

                    control.<br><br>

                    To create a working proof of concept, I first had to create the animations for the game. I used
                    Procreate to draw the animations from the game from
                    scratch. I then implemented the game using the animations and C# in Unity. For this game, I created
                    a Git-like tree structure. Using the in-game command prompt, players are able to “git commit” to
                    save a moment in time, “git branch” to branch timelines, and “git checkout” return to previously
                    saved commits.<br><br>

                    <br>Although the game does not serve as direct instructional material. However, as Git is a rite of
                    passage for new developers, it serves as supplementary material for new developers to be more
                    comfortable with using Git.<br><br>

                    control.<br><br>

                    Throughout the course of the semester, I had many roles for the project. When it came to designing
                    the models for the application, I designed the account, server, search, and messaging system. When
                    we were working on the console program, I implemented the entire front end and served as the team’s
                    go-to debugger. Additionally, I designed the color scheme, logo, and most of the templates for the
                    prototype.<br><br>

                    After months of working, we had a console program that had the ability to create accounts, listings,
                    direct messaging, as well as search and generate leases. Additionally, our professor was so
                    impressed with the prototype, she saved the video to use as material to teach future
                    students.<br><br>

                <p>During my second semester, in my Visualization Tools class, we were given a simple challenge: create
                    a visualization with any approved data set.<br><br>

                    The prompt was vague enough. I thought about how around 40% of homicides go unsolved, and it is
                    estimated that there are currently 30 active serial killers in the United States. Therefore, serial
                    killers pose an active threat to public safety, and if they do commit murder, many of them will get
                    away with it. However, serial killers do not operate completely randomly. Many follow an M.O., or a
                    habit of working and may have a preferred weapon of choice or a preferred targeted demographic.
                    Consequently, their preferences may manifest as recurring patterns in data.<br><br>

                    So, I created a dashboard with the intended audience of people who are searching for unknown serial
                    killers or trying to connect unknown homicides with recorded serial killers. Therefore, this project
                    would be most useful for law enforcement organizations and perhaps, bringing closure to the victims'
                    loved ones.<br><br>

                    The visualization I chose to create uses a map with graduated circles, a heatmap that displays
                    co-occurring factors, and supplementary histograms and bar charts. All of which respond to dynamic
                    filtering. The filters help narrow the search, the map shows where crimes occurred, the heatmap
                    shows how different factors occur together, and the histograms/bar charts help interpret the
                    results. Check out the <a

                        project report</a>, I explain how this visualization could have been used to detect Jeffrey
                    Dahmer knowing his M.O. I also show how other murders with unknown suspects may be connected to him.
